\title{\pkg{quantities}: Quantity Calculus for R Vectors}
\description{
Support for painless automatic units and uncertainty propagation in numerical
operations. Both \pkg{units} and \pkg{errors} are integrated into a complete
quantity calculus system within the R language. R vectors, matrices and arrays
automatically propagate those attributes when you operate with \code{quantities}
objects.
